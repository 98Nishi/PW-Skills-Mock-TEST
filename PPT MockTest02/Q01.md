Q1: 1. Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each.

Ans: 1. Static==>
         position: static is the default value that an element will have. This means if you don't declare position for an element in CSS, it will automatically be set to static.
         Example--
         <!-- <style>
           .static-position { position: static;background-color: red;} </style>
        <div class="static-position">This is a static positioned element.</div>-->     
      2. Fixed==>
         Elements with position: fixed are positioned relative to the viewport, i.e., they stay in the same position even if the page is scrolled.
         Example--
         <!----html
         <div class="fixed-position">Fixed Element</div>
         CSS
         .fixed-position {position: fixed;top: 20px;left: 20px;} -->
     3. Sticky==>
        Position: sticky elements will initially behave like position: relative elements, but if you keep scrolling, they will get taken out of the normal flow and behave like position: fixed wherever you have positioned them.
        Example--
        <!-- html==><div class="sticky-position">This is a sticky positioned element.</div>
             CSS==> .sticky-position {position: sticky;top: 50px;}----->
     4. Relative==>
        Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal flow position.They can be moved using top, bottom, left, or right properties, without affecting other elements.
        Example--
        <!-- CSS==> <style> .relative-position { position: relative; top: 20px; left: 30px;} </style> -->
     5. Absolute==>
        Elements with position: absolute are positioned based on their nearest parent element that has a position other than static. If there is no such parent, they are positioned relative to the document itself.
        Example--
        <!-- <div class="parent"><div class="absolute-position">Absolutely Positioned Element</div></div>
        .parent {position: relative;}.absolute-position { position: absolute; top: 20px; left: 20px;background-color: yellow;}------>
